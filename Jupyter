# Simple Jupyter Notebook - English Version

## Introduction
#This notebook is designed to introduce the most fundamental concepts in Python.

## Part 1: Variables and Operations
#We'll store values in variables and perform arithmetic operations.

# Assign values to variables
number_1 = 20
number_2 = 15
print(f"The value of number_1 is: {number_1}")
print(f"The value of number_2 is: {number_2}")

# Perform addition and subtraction
addition = number_1 + number_2
subtraction = number_1 - number_2
print(f"The result of addition is: {addition}")
print(f"The result of subtraction is: {subtraction}")

## Part 2: Working with Strings
#You can store text in variables and combine them.

# Create string variables
greeting = "Hello"
name = "World"

# Combine strings
full_message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(full_message)

# Repeat a string
repeat_message = "Python" * 3
print(repeat_message)


## Part 3: Lists
#Lists allow you to store multiple values in a single variable.

# Create a list
fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"]
print(f"Original list: {fruits}")

# Add an item to the list
fruits.append("Grape")
print(f"List after adding 'Grape': {fruits}")

# Access an item by its index
first_fruit = fruits[0]
print(f"The first item in the list is: {first_fruit}")


## Conclusion
#This notebook has introduced basic concepts of variables, operations, strings, and lists. These are the core building blocks of Python programming.
